# About

Very basic code sample to create a MS-Access database via a Nuget package and Entity Framework Core.

:fleur_de_lis: Why? 

Because there are develoers still using Access database using managed data providers and this is one way to get them to move to Entity Framework Core followed by upgrading to a better database such as Microsoft SQL-Server.


## InitialDatabaseSetup class

- Responsible for 
    - Creating the database and tables.
    - Populating tables
