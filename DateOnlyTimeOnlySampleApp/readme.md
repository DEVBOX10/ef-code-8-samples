# About

An example for working with `DateOnly` and `Json columns`.

The code was taken from this repository [project](https://github.com/dotnet/EntityFramework.Docs/tree/main/samples/core/Miscellaneous/NewInEFCore8) and modified for the reader to learn from even though the original code is easy to follow but was generic to suite several different ways of writing the code.

- Connection string is read from appsettings.json
    - Currently set to create Karen5 database under localdb, might want to change the name
- EF Core logs to a file under the application folder
