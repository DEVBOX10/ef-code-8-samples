# Entity Framework Core 8 code samples

The intent for this repository is to demonstrate new features for Entity Framework Core 8. Base [code samples](https://github.com/dotnet/EntityFramework.Docs/tree/main/samples/core/Miscellaneous/NewInEFCore8) were obtained **from Microsoft** which are fantastic but not setup for newcomers to learn from so those code samples were simply refactored for ease of learning.

> **Note**
> Extracting code samples is not as easy as many developers would think, hopefully they are of use.
